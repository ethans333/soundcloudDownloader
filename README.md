# SoundCloud Downloader üéõÔ∏è
Download SoundCloud songs **with all their id3 tags** such as an album cover! Just paste your urls 
into the ```Song Urls.csv``` file and run the program. Happy listening! :blush:

## Instructions :memo:
Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are installed!

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/ethans333/soundcloudTerminal
```

Or, if you'd like to avoid downloading [Git](https://git-scm.com/) you can just download the code from [this repository](https://github.com/ethans333/soundcloudTerminal).<br><br>

Go into the main file's directory
```
cd ./soundcloudDownloader
cd ./Scripts
```

To install the dependencies, run

```
npm install
```

## Use :thinking:	

Paste your urls in the ```Song Urls.csv``` file. Paste your urls like so
```
url1
url2
...
```
Note: Make sure your urls are the song's page! This format: **https://soundcloud.com/[artist-name]/[song-title]**

Start the program and make sure you're in the ```Path to repository/soundcloudDownloader/Scripts```
```
npm start
```

Made this project for myself because I pay for Spotify Premium but there's no way im going to also pay for SoundCloud Go.
So I download the songs using my program with all their id3 tags into a folder and then tell spotify to upload that to a
local server, getting SoundCloud songs on my phone. If there are any issues, bugs or you just need help let me know and I'll
be happy to get back to you! Thanks for trying out my program!
